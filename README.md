# ChatFORTH
FORTH, originally designed as a conversational environment, has evolved to include AI chatbot support with the addition of new commands. This development has transformed FORTH into an innovative and comfortable development environment with AI assistance always at your side. Unlike traditional chatbots that are solely for conversation, ChatFORTH is a genuine computer language environment where users can use AI through running programs to accomplish large amounts of work.

To start chatting on ChatFORTH, simply start your message with exactly one leading space or use the 'user:' command followed by your message. Additionally, you can utilize frequently used commands through macros without having to type them repeatedly. Context editing allows for redirection of conversations and error correction while providing more information for the AI to analyze data insights seamlessly.
